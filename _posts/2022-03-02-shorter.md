# Section A

Let's discuss manifolds. We're going to be pictoral and stay mostly with this, then we're going to get specific and examine some of these ideas in lcoal coordinates, symbolically. We will come right up to, but won't explciitly define, curvature. 

# Let's discuss it

c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install kaleido

```python
print('Hello World!')
```
Of course, it has to be Hello World, right?

These examples use the python version of plotly in a collab notebook. Here are some convenience functions I wrote you can copy to make things easier. All code examples below call these convenience functions

# Surface and Curve

So we can draw our manifold from a chart. And we can draw a curve in cartesian space, and use the inverse chart map to lift the curve to lie on the manifold.
